# Insurance AI Agents

A collection of simple and clean LangChain agents for insurance document processing, including timeline generation and question-answering with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## Features

### Timeline Agent

- **LangChain Agent Framework**: Uses ReAct pattern for intelligent reasoning
- **Map-Reduce Pattern**: Processes text in chunks and combines results
- **Refine Pattern**: Iteratively refines timeline with new information
- **Chronological Processing**: Automatically sorts events by date
- **Event Type Classification**: Standardizes event types (POLICY_START, CLAIM_FILED, etc.)
- **Date Estimation**: Handles approximate dates intelligently

### QnA Agent

- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for accurate question answering
- **Vector Search**: Uses Chroma DB with OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- **Context-Aware**: Answers questions based on relevant document chunks
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time question answering interface
- **Chunk Processing**: Splits documents into 200-character chunks with 30-character overlap

### Common Features

- **Simple API**: Clean functional interface with pattern selection
- **Multiple Agents**: Choose between Timeline and QnA agents
- **Verbose Logging**: Track processing steps with detailed prints

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Interactive agent selector (Timeline, QnA, or Both)
python main.py

# Run QnA agent with interactive mode
python qna_main.py
```

### Agent Options

When running `python main.py`, you'll see:

```
üöÄ Insurance AI Agents
==================================================
1. Timeline Agent - Creates chronological timelines
2. QnA Agent - Answers questions using RAG
3. Both agents
==================================================
Select an agent (1/2/3):
```

### QnA Agent Features

The QnA agent includes:

- **Automatic Vector Store Creation**: Builds knowledge base from events.txt
- **Semantic Search**: Finds 3 most relevant chunks for each question
- **Sample Questions**: Pre-loaded test questions for demonstration
- **Interactive Mode**: Ask custom questions in real-time

### Example QnA Session

```
‚ùì Your question: When did John Smith purchase his auto insurance?
üí° Answer: John Smith purchased auto insurance on January 15, 2023, with a premium of $1,200 annually.

‚ùì Your question: What was the settlement amount for the claim?
üí° Answer: The settlement check was $2,350 to cover the vehicle repairs.
```

## Architecture

### Timeline Agent Processing Patterns:

- **Map-Reduce**: Splits text into chunks, extracts events from each chunk (map), then combines all events into final timeline (reduce)
- **Refine**: Processes first chunk to create initial timeline, then iteratively refines with each subsequent chunk

### QnA Agent RAG Pipeline:

1. **Document Loading**: Reads events.txt content
2. **Text Splitting**: Creates 200-character chunks with 30-character overlap
3. **Embedding**: Uses OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations
4. **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in Chroma database
5. **Query Processing**: Embeds user question and retrieves 3 most relevant chunks
6. **Answer Generation**: Sends context and question to LLM for answer generation

### Agent Framework:

- Uses LangChain's ReAct agent pattern for both agents
- Powered by GPT-4o-mini for optimal performance
- Tools are dynamically created based on selected agent type
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Example Output

```
2023-01-15 - POLICY_START - Auto insurance purchased
2023-02-01 - PAYMENT_MADE - First premium payment made
2023-03-11 - INCIDENT_REPORTED - Incident reported to insurance company
2023-03-12 - CLAIM_FILED - Claim officially filed with claim number CL-2023-0045
2023-03-15 - ADJUSTER_ASSIGNED - Adjuster assigned to the case
2023-03-16 - INVESTIGATION_STARTED - Investigation began to determine fault and assess damages
2023-04-02 - INVESTIGATION_COMPLETED - Investigation completed; John not at fault
2023-04-05 - CLAIM_APPROVED - Claim approved; settlement check issued
2024-01-15 - POLICY_RENEWAL - Policy automatically renewed with premium increase
```
