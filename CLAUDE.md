## Development Workflow

### Overview
This document outlines the standard workflow to follow when working on the codebase. The goal is to maintain clarity, simplicity, and effective communication throughout the development process.

### Steps
1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Thoroughly read the relevant parts of the codebase.
   - Identify the specific problem or feature you are addressing.
2. **Create a Plan**
   - Document your plan in `tasks/todo.md`.
   - If the folder does not exist, create it.
   - Include a clear list of actionable todo items that can be checked off as you complete them.
3. **Verify the Plan**
   - Before proceeding, check in with me to review and verify the plan.
   - Make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.
4. **Execute the Plan**
   - Begin working on the todo items sequentially.
   - Mark each item as complete once you finish it.
5. **Document Changes**
   - Provide a high-level explanation of each step you take.
   - Explain the changes made and the rationale behind them to keep me informed.
6. **Maintain Simplicity**
   - Strive to keep every task and code change simple.
   - Avoid large or complex modifications; each change should affect as little code as possible.
7. **Review Section**
   - At the end of the process, add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`.
   - Summarize your changes and include any additional relevant information.

### Example Todo Item Format
- [ ] **Task Name**: Brief description of the task.
- **Details**: Explain what needs to be done.
- **Expected Outcome**: Describe what the successful completion looks like.
